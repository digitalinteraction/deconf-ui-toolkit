# vue3 notes

- need to setup lint-staged again
- sort out peerDependencies
- setup storybook again
- migrate to vue-router@next
  https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/migration/#breaking-changes
- ...Field components only allow strings - need lots of testing
- is `<component/>` still allowed?
- does the new reactive Temporal & Dev plugin work?
